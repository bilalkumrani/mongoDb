	why id is important ?
	- every document must have a unique_id value
	-  when we insert new doc mongo populates the _id field with a value of objectId() type
	
	- Identical documents can exist in the same collection as long as their _id values are different.
	- Mongodb has schema validation functionality allows you to enforce document structure.
	
	
	
	::Inserting Documents: Order
	
	 - db.inspections.insert([ { "test": 1 }, { "test": 2 }, { "test": 3 } ])
	 
	 - where ever it finds _id field duplicate the insertion operation will be stopped there
	 - if we want to insert all unique docs then we have to give another object {ordered:false}
	 
	 
	 
	 ::Updating database
	 
	 some update operators:
	 $inc - increment field value by specified amount
	 $set - sets field value to a new specified value
	 $push - adds an element field
	 
	
	Deleting documents and collections:
	
	- drop()
